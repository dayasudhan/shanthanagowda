Fully aware that the dead lines issued by his predecessors remained only on papers Kumaraswamy made it sure that the infrastructure works are completed on time In spite of being CM of Karnataka he did not want to put fellow motorist in inconvenience while traveling he ordered the officers not to put traffic curbs unnecessarily. He wanted to travel like a common man for city inspection, to review the progress of the projects. He choose to go on inspection once a month at night from 10 am till midnight so as not to cause inconvenience to the people.

Loan and 4% interest is by no means a popular measure it came as a result of deep understanding that availability cheap credit is a principal need of agriculture today, The Reserve bank of India appreciated the fiscal reform measures taken while the credit rating information service of India limited (CRISIL) had placed Karnataka in AA-grade based on the economic progress achieved The budget presented under his leadership has concept of gender based budgeting which helped to prioritize public expenditure to respect the concern of the Women.The new industrilal policy 2006-2011 emphasized the proper infrastructure will result in Industrialization\n" +
